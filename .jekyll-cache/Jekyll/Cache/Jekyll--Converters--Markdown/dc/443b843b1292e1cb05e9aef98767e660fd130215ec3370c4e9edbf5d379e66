<h2 id="difference-bw-parametric--non-parametric-models">Difference b/w parametric &amp; non-parametric models</h2>
<p><strong><em>[Source: ISLR Page-21]</em>:</strong></p>

<p>Parametric methods involve a two-step model-based approach.</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, we make an assumption about the functional form, or shape of f. For example, one very simple assumption is that f is linear in X:</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?f(x)=\beta_0&plus;\beta_1x_1&plus;\beta_2x_2&plus;\cdots&plus;\beta_px_p\cdots\cdots(2.4)" /></p>

<p>This is a linear model, which will be discussed extensively in Chapter 3. Once we have assumed that f is linear, the problem of estimating f is greatly simplified. Instead of having to estimate an entirely arbitrary p-dimensional function f(X), one only needs to estimate the p+1 coefficients <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\beta_0,&space;\beta_1x_1,&space;\beta_2x_2,&space;\cdots,&space;\beta_px_p" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>After a model has been selected, we need a procedure that uses the training data to fit or train the model. In the case of the linear model (2.4), we need to estimate the parameters <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\beta_0,&space;\beta_1x_1,&space;\beta_2x_2,&space;\cdots,&space;\beta_px_p" />. That is, we want to find values of these parameters such that,
<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Y\approx\beta_0&plus;\beta_1x_1&plus;\beta_2x_2&plus;\cdots&plus;\beta_px_p" /></li>
</ol>

<p>Non-parametric methods do not make explicit assumptions about the functional form of <em>f</em>. Instead, they seek an estimate of <em>f</em> that gets as close to the data points as possible without being too rough or wiggly.</p>

<p>Some examples of parametric and non-parametric models:</p>

<h2 id="advantagesdisadvantages-of-parametricnon-parametric-models">Advantages/disadvantages of Parametric/Non-Parametric models</h2>
<p><strong><em>[Source: ISLR Page-23]</em>:</strong></p>

<p>Non-parametric approaches can have a major advantage over parametric approaches: by avoiding the assumption of a particular functional form for <em>f</em>, they have the potential to accurately fit a wider range of possible shapes for f. Any parametric approach brings with it the possibility that the functional form used to estimate f is very different from the true f, in which case the resulting model will not fit the data well.</p>

<p>In contrast, non-parametric approaches completely avoid this danger, since essentially no assumption about the form of f is made. But non-parametric approaches do suffer from a major disadvantage: since they do not reduce the problem of estimating f to a small number of parameters, a very large number of observations (far more than is typically needed for a parametric approach) is required in order to obtain an accurate estimate for f.</p>
<h1 id="bias--variance">Bias &amp; Variance</h1>
<h2 id="what-do-we-mean-by-the-variance-and-bias-of-a-statistical-learning-method">What do we mean by the variance and bias of a statistical learning method?</h2>
<p><strong>Variance</strong> refers to the amount by which <em>f</em> would change if we estimated it using a different training data set. Since the training data are used to fit the statistical learning method, different training data sets will result in a different <em>f</em> . But ideally the estimate for <em>f</em> should not vary too much between training sets. However, if a method has high variance, then small changes in the training data can result in large changes in <em>f</em>. In general, more flexible statistical methods have higher variance.</p>

<p>On the other hand,</p>

<p><strong>Bias</strong> refers to the error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem, which may be extremely complicated, by a much simpler model. For example, linear regression assumes that there is a linear relationship between <em>Y</em> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?X_1,X_2,\cdots,X_p" />. It is unlikely that any real-life problem truly has such a simple linear relationship, and so performing linear regression will undoubtedly result in some bias in the estimate of <em>f</em>.</p>

</ol>

<p>Following are the assumptions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Random error <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\varepsilon" /> has <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?E(\varepsilon)=0" /></li>
  <li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\varepsilon" /> is independent of X</li>
  <li><strong>[Source: ISLR Page-86]</strong>: Two of the most important assumptions state that the relationship between the predictors and response are additive and linear. The additive assumption means that the effect of changes in a predictor <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?X_j" /> on the response Y is independent of the values of the other predictors. The linear assumption states that the change in the response Y due to a one-unit change in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?X_j" /> is constant, regardless of the value of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?X_j" /></li>
  <li><strong>[Source: ISLR Page-93]</strong>: An important assumption of the linear regression model is that the error terms, Œµ1,Œµ2,‚Äà‚Ä¶,Œµn, are uncorrelated.</li>
  <li><strong>[Source: ISLR Page-95]</strong>: Error terms have a constant variance, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?Var(\varepsilon_i)=\sigma^2" />. Unfortunately, it is often the case that the variances of the error terms are non-constant. For instance, the variances of the error terms may increase with the value of the response. One can identify non-constant variances in the errors, or heteroscedasticity, from the presence of a funnel shape in the residual plot.
    <h2 id="implication-of-the-assumption-that-errors-are-independent--identically-distributed">Implication of the assumption that errors are independent &amp; identically distributed</h2>
    <p>Because of this assumption, we average squared errors uniformly in our Expected Prediction error criterion. If the errors were dependent, then, weightage of each error might have been different in the error function.</p>

<p><strong>Collinearity</strong>¬†is a linear association between¬†two¬†explanatory variables. Multicollinearity in a multiple regression model are highly linearly related associations between¬†two or more¬†explanatory variables.</p>

<p>In case of perfect <strong>multicollinearity</strong>, the design matrix¬†X has less than full rank, and therefore the moment matrix¬†<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?X^TX" />¬†cannot be matrix inverted. Under these circumstances, for a general linear model¬†<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?y=x\beta+\epsilon" />, the ordinary least-squares estimator <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\beta_{OLS}={(X^TX)}^{-1}X^Ty" /> does not exist.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-assess-multicollinearity">How to assess Multicollinearity?</h2>
<p><strong><em>[Source: ISLR Page-101]</em></strong> Instead of inspecting the correlation matrix, a better way to assess multicollinearity is to compute the variance inflation factor (VIF). The VIF is variance inflation factor, the ratio of the variance of Œ≤j when fitting the full model divided by the variance of Œ≤j if fit on its own. The smallest possible value for VIF is 1, which indicates the complete absence of collinearity</p>

<h2 id="how-to-assess-the-quality-of-linear-regression-model">How to assess the quality of Linear Regression model?</h2>
<p><strong><em>[Source: ISLR Page-68]</em></strong>. The quality of a linear regression fit is typically assessed using two related quantities: the residual standard error (RSE) and the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?R^2" /> statistic.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ds-interview/Aspose.Words.95ba44c8-92c8-4d90-8a97-630964b6dcab.001.png" alt="A picture containing text, clock, watch Description automatically generated" /></p>

<p>where,</p>

<p><img src="/images/ds-interview/RSS.png" alt="A picture containing chart Description automatically generated" /></p>

<p>The RSE provides an absolute measure of lack of fit of the model (3.5) to the data. But since it is measured in the units of Y, it is not always clear what constitutes a good RSE. The <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?R^2" /> statistic provides an alternative measure of fit. It takes the form of a proportion‚Äîthe proportion of variance explained‚Äîand so it always takes on a value between 0 and 1, and is independent of the scale of Y.</p>

<p>To calculate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?R^2" />, we use the formula,</p>

<p><img src="/images/ds-interview/Aspose.Words.95ba44c8-92c8-4d90-8a97-630964b6dcab.002.png" alt="Text Description automatically generated" /></p>

<p>Where,</p>

<p><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?TSS=\sum{(y_i-\bar{y})^2}" /> is the total sum of squares, and RSS is defined in (3.16). TSS measures the total variance in the response Y, and can be thought of as the amount of variability inherent in the response before the regression is performed. In contrast, RSS measures the amount of variability that is left unexplained after performing the regression. Hence, TSS ‚àí RSS measures the amount of variability in the response that is explained (or removed) by performing the regression, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?R^2" /> measures the proportion of variability in Y that can be explained using X.</p>

<p>The odds ratio is the probability of success/probability of failure. As an equation, that‚Äôs P(A)/P(-A), where P(A) is the probability of A, and P(-A) the probability of ‚Äònot A‚Äô (i.e. the complement of A).</p>

<p>Taking the logarithm of the odds ratio gives us the log odds of A, which can be written as</p>

<p>log(A) = log(P(A)/P(-A)),
Since the probability of an event happening, P(-A) is equal to the probability of an event not happening, 1 ‚Äì P(A), we can write the log odds as</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-when-the-classes-are-well-separated-in-logistic-regression">What happens when the classes are well separated in Logistic Regression?</h2>
<p>When the classes are well-separated, the parameter estimates for the logistic regression model are surprisingly unstable. Linear discriminant analysis does not suffer from this problem.
<strong><em>[Source: ESLR, Page-128]</em></strong> If the data in a two-class logistic regression model can be perfectly separated by a hyperplane, the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters are undefined (i.e., infinite; see Exercise 4.5). The LDA coefficients for the same data will be well defined, since the marginal likelihood will not permit these degeneracies.

<h2 id="compare-svm--logistic-regression">Compare SVM &amp; Logistic Regression</h2>
<p><strong><em>[Source: ISLR Page-357]</em></strong> SVM loss function is exactly zero for observations for which <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?y_i(\beta_0&plus;\beta_1x_{i1}&plus;\cdots&plus;\beta_px_{ip})&gt;=1&space;" />  these correspond to observations that are on the correct side of the margin. In contrast, the loss function for logistic regression is not exactly zero anywhere. But it is very small for observations that are far from the decision boundary. Due to the similarities between their loss functions,  logistic regression and the support vector classifier often give very similar results. When the classes are well separated, SVMs tend to behave better than logistic regression; in more overlapping regimes, logistic regression is often preferred.</p>

<h1 id="knn">KNN</h1>
<h2 id="effect-of-k-on-training-error">Effect of K on training error</h2>
<p><strong><em>[Source: ESLR Page 15]</em></strong> Error on the training data should be approximately an increasing function of k, and will always be 0 for k = 1. 
It appears that k-nearest-neighbor fits have a single parameter, the number of neighbors k, compared to the p parameters in least-squares fits. Although this is the case, we will see that the effective number of parameters of k-nearest neighbors is N/k and is generally bigger than p, and decreases with increasing k. To get an idea of why, note that if the neighborhoods were nonoverlapping, there would be N/k neighborhoods and we would fit one parameter (a mean) in each neighborhood. It is also clear that we cannot use sum-of-squared errors on the training</p>

<p>set as a criterion for picking k, since we would always pick k = 1.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-bias--variance-vary-for-knn-with-the-choice-of-k">How does bias &amp; variance vary for KNN with the choice of K?</h2>
<p><strong><em>[Source: ESLR Page 40]</em></strong> The choice of K has a drastic effect on the KNN classifier obtained. When K = 1, the decision boundary is overly flexible and finds patterns in the data that don‚Äôt correspond to the Bayes decision boundary. This corresponds to a classifier that has low bias but very high variance. As K grows, the method becomes less flexible and produces a decision boundary that is close to linear. This corresponds to a low-variance but high-bias classifier. 
Just as in the regression setting, there is not a strong relationship between the training error rate and the test error rate. With K = 1, the KNN training error rate is 0, but the test error rate may be quite high. In general, as we use more flexible classification methods, the training error rate will decline but the test error rate may not.</p>

<p>Of course, this is not practical because we generally do not have access to multiple training sets. Instead, we can bootstrap, by taking repeated samples from the (single) training data set. In this approach we generate B different bootstrapped training data sets.

<h2 id="oob-error-estimation">OOB Error Estimation</h2>

<p><strong><em>[Source: ISLR Page-317]</em></strong> The key to bagging is that trees are repeatedly fit to bootstrapped subsets of the observations. One can show that on average, each bagged tree makes use of around two-thirds of the observations. The remaining one-third of the observations not used to fit a given bagged tree are referred to as the out-of-bag (OOB) observations. We can predict the response for the ith observation using each of the trees in which that observation was OOB. This will yield around B/3 predictions for the ith observation. In order to obtain a single prediction for the ith observation, we can average these predicted responses (if regression is the goal) or can take a  majority vote (if classification is the goal). This leads to a single OOB prediction for the ith observation. An OOB prediction can be obtained in this way for each of the n observations, from which the overall OOB MSE (for a regression problem) or classification error (for a classification  problem) can be computed. The resulting OOB error is a valid estimate of the test error for the  bagged model, since the response for each observation is predicted using only the trees that were not fit using that observation.</p>

<h2 id="how-random-forests-ensure-that-trees-are-decorrelated">How Random Forests ensure that trees are decorrelated?</h2>

<p><strong><em>[Source: ISLR Page-320]</em></strong> Random forests provide an improvement over bagged trees by way of a random small tweak  that decorrelates the trees. As in bagging, we build a number  forest of decision trees on bootstrapped training samples. But when building these decision trees, each time a split in a tree is considered, a random sample of m predictors is chosen as split candidates from the full set of p predictors. The split is allowed to use only one of those m predictors. A fresh sample of ‚àöm predictors is taken at each split, and typically we choose m ‚âà p‚Äîthat is, the number of predictors considered at each split is approximately equal to the square root of the total number of predictors (4 out of the 13 for the Heart data). In other words, in building a random forest, at each split in the tree, the algorithm is not even allowed to consider a majority of the available predictors. This may sound crazy, but it has a clever rationale. Suppose that there is one very strong predictor in the data set, along with a number of other moderately strong predictors. Then in the collection of bagged trees, most or all of the trees will use this strong predictor in the top split. Consequently, all of the bagged trees will look quite similar to each other. Hence the predictions from the bagged trees will be highly correlated. Unfortunately, averaging many highly correlated quantities does not lead to as large of a reduction in variance as averaging many uncorrelated quantities. In particular, this means that bagging will not lead to a substantial reduction in variance over a single tree in this setting. Random forests overcome this problem by forcing each split to consider only a subset of the predictors. Therefore, on average (p ‚àí m)/p of the splits will not even consider the strong predictor, and so other predictors will have more of a chance. We can think of this process as decorrelating the trees, thereby making the average of the resulting trees less variable and hence more reliable. The main difference between bagging and random forests is the choice of predictor subset size m. For instance, if a random forest is built using m = p, then this amounts simply to bagging.</p>

<p>In a network of n hidden layers, n derivatives will be multiplied together. If the derivatives are large then the gradient will increase exponentially as we propagate down the model until they eventually explode, and this is what we call the problem of exploding gradient.

</ol>

<p>Gradient clipping involves forcing the gradients to a certain number when they go above or below a defined threshold.</p>

<p><strong>Types of Clipping techniques</strong>
Gradient clipping can be applied in two common ways:</p>

<p><strong>Clipping by value</strong> : If a gradient exceeds some threshold value, we clip that gradient to the threshold. If the gradient is less than the lower limit then we clip that too, to the lower limit of the threshold. The algorithm is as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>g ‚Üê ‚àÇC/‚àÇW
if ‚Äñg‚Äñ ‚â• max_threshold or ‚Äñg‚Äñ ‚â§ min_threshold then
    g ‚Üê threshold (accordingly)
end if where max\_threshold and min\_threshold are the boundary values and between them lies a range of values that gradients can take. g, here is the gradient, and  ‚Äñg ‚Äñ is the norm of g. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Clipping by norm</strong>: We clip the gradients by multiplying the unit vector of the gradients with the threshold. 
The algorithm is as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>g ‚Üê ‚àÇC/‚àÇW
if ‚Äñg‚Äñ ‚â• threshold then
    g ‚Üê threshold * g/‚Äñg‚Äñ
end if where the threshold is a hyperparameter, g is the gradient, and  ‚Äñg ‚Äñ is the norm of g. Since g/‚Äñ g‚Äñ is a unit vector, after rescaling the new g will have norm equal to threshold. Note that if  ‚Äñg‚Äñ &lt; c, then we don‚Äôt need to do anything,
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Gradient clipping ensures the gradient vector g has norm at most equal to threshold.</p>

<p>Systematic sampling is a type of probability <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sampling-distribution.asp">sampling method</a> in which sample members from a larger population are selected according to a random starting point but with a fixed, periodic interval. This interval, called the sampling interval, is calculated by dividing the population size by the desired sample size. Despite the sample population being selected in advance, systematic sampling is still thought of as being random if the periodic interval is determined beforehand and the starting point is random.</p>

  <li>Null hypothesis, H<sub>0</sub> - represents a hypothesis of chance basis.</li>
  <li>Alternative hypothesis, H<sub>a</sub> - represents a hypothesis of observations which are influenced by some non-random cause.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hypothesis testing is an act in statistics whereby an analyst <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wilcoxon-test.asp">tests</a> an assumption regarding a population parameter. The methodology employed by the analyst depends on the nature of the data used and the reason for the analysis.</p>

<p>Hypothesis testing is used to assess the plausibility of a hypothesis by using sample data. Such data may come from a larger population, or from a data-generating process. The word ‚Äúpopulation‚Äù will be used for both of these cases in the following descriptions.</p>

<p><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Hypothesis testing is used to assess the plausibility of a hypothesis by using sample data.</li>
  <li>The test provides evidence concerning the plausibility of the hypothesis, given the data.</li>
  <li>Statistical analysts test a hypothesis by measuring and examining a random sample of the population being analyzed.</li>
</ul>

  <li><strong>One hot encoding with Multiple Categories</strong>: In this technique, instead of creating the new column for every category, they limit creating the new column for 10 most frequent categories.</li>
  <li><strong>Ordinal Number Encoding:</strong> In this technique, each unique category value is given an integer value. For instance, ‚Äúred‚Äù equals 1, ‚Äúgreen‚Äù equals 2 and ‚Äúblue‚Äù equals 3.</li>
  <li><strong>Count or Frequency Encoding:</strong> In this technique we will substitute the categories by the count of the observations that show that category in the dataset</li>
  <li><strong>Target Guided Ordinal Encoding:</strong>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose a categorical variable.</li>
      <li>Take the aggregated mean of the categorical variable and apply it to the target variable.</li>
      <li>Assign higher integer values or a higher rank to the category with the highest mean.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mean Ordinal Encoding:</strong>¬†Replace the category with the obtained mean value instead of assigning integer values to it.</li>
  <li><strong>Probability Ratio Encoding:</strong> This technique is suitable for classification problems only when the target variable is binary(Either 1 or 0 or True or False). In this technique, we will substitute the category value with the probability ratio i.e. P(1)/P(0).
    <ol>
      <li>Using the categorical variable, evaluate the probability of the Target variable (where the output is True or 1).</li>
      <li>Calculate the probability of the Target variable having a False or 0 output.</li>
      <li>Calculate the probability ratio i.e. P(True or 1) / P(False or 0).</li>
